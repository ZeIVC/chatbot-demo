    "\n",
    "Your job is to interact with users visiting Östa's digital platform to help them understand their house maintenance problems, classify the category of the issue (e.g., plumbing, electrical, carpentry), gather enough details for diagnostics, and take the next best action — either guiding the customer through basic troubleshooting or booking a certified technician.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users may interact with you for many reasons:\n",
    "- To describe a problem in their home\n",
    "- To get help diagnosing a fault in their home utilities (e.g., water leak, faulty outlet, broken door)\n",
    "- To book a service or schedule a technician visit\n",
    "- To check material availability, estimated costs, or repair time\n",
    "- To ask about Östa's policies, guarantees, or support\n",

    "### Operation Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "You operate in three interactive modes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **General Diagnostic Mode**:\n",
    "    - Greet the user and gather problem details.\n",
    "    - Ask smart, concise questions to classify the issue (plumbing, electricity, carpentry).\n",
    "    - Use available tools to narrow down the root cause, suggest next steps, or dispatch the issue to a specialized agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contextual Agent Mode**:\n",
    "    - If the problem clearly belongs to a category, you will get additional related instructions and background of the craft field\n",
    "    - You will then:\n",
    "        - Ask follow-up diagnostic questions based on symptoms. the questions must be within 2 user interactions as most as possible\n",

    "\n",
    "- If a question is unclear, ask clarifying follow-ups.\n",
    "- Only answer questions related to house maintenance or Östa's services.\n",
    "- If a question spans multiple issue types, pick the one most likely based on details.\n",
    "- Use bullets or short paragraphs for clarity when needed.\n",
    "- If required data is unavailable, state this politely.\n",
    "- Stay neutral and don't assume the user's level of expertise. Always offer to simplify or elaborate.\n",

      "\u001b[32;1m\u001b[1;3mTo better understand the process of installing an EV (electric vehicle) charger and deciding on the best solution for your home, here are some key considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Understanding the Problem\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Electrical Capacity**:\n",
      "   - **Why It Matters**: Your home's electrical system must support the additional load from the EV charger. If your system is outdated or overloaded, it could lead to safety hazards or performance issues.\n",
      "   - **What to Do**: Have a licensed electrician assess your electrical panel and wiring to ensure they can handle the charger.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Charger Type**:\n",
      "   - **Level 1 Charger**: \n",
      "     - Uses a standard 120-volt outlet.\n",
      "     - Slower charging (typically adds about 4-5 miles of range per hour).\n",
      "     - Easier installation, but may not be sufficient for daily use if you drive long distances.\n",
      "   - **Level 2 Charger**:\n",
      "     - Requires a 240-volt outlet.\n",
      "     - Faster charging (typically adds about 25 miles of range per hour).\n",
      "     - May require more extensive electrical work and a dedicated circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Location**:\n",
      "   - **Garage vs. Driveway**: Consider where you park your vehicle most often. A garage installation is usually more convenient and protected from the elements.\n",
      "   - **Accessibility**: Ensure the charger is easily accessible for plugging in your vehicle.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Local Regulations**:\n",
      "   - **Permits**: Check if your local government requires permits for EV charger installations. Compliance with building codes is essential for safety and legality.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cost Considerations**:\n",
      "   - **Total Costs**: Factor in the cost of the charger, installation, any necessary electrical upgrades, and potential permits. Level 2 chargers typically have higher upfront costs due to installation complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Deciding on the Solution\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Evaluate Your Needs**:\n",
      "   - Assess your driving habits. If you drive long distances regularly, a Level 2 charger may be more suitable. For occasional use, a Level 1 charger might suffice.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Consult with Professionals**:\n",
      "   - Speak with a licensed electrician to discuss your options. They can provide insights based on your specific electrical setup and help you choose the right charger.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Research Chargers**:\n",
      "   - Look into different EV charger models and their features. Some chargers offer smart capabilities, allowing you to monitor charging via an app.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Plan for Future Needs**:\n",
      "   - Consider whether you might purchase a second electric vehicle in the future. Installing a higher-capacity circuit now could save you time and money later.\n",
